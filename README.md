#[Link to Travis Lite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-to-travis-lite/)

![Screenshot of the add-on](doc/travis-lite-screenshot.png)

When I get linked to a [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) page, my computer
sometimes isn't able to handle the awesomeness of the JS on the page. I'll
often want to just hit [travis-lite.com](http://travis-lite.com) instead. I got
lazy to change the URL and wrote this add-on.

If you find it helpful, I'm glad to be of help. Please file bugs.
